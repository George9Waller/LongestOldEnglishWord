# LongestOldEnglishWord
An algorithm to find the longest word in a reduced alphabet: 


### ---Algorithm brief---

There once was a language call old english

No letters i and l had betwixt

Zebra or czarists could not be writ

And q and v did not persist


Tis from this alphabet you should write a script

to find the longest word that could exist.

# Countdown Solver
Based off the code for the previous problem I adjusted the program to take into acount the repetition of letters and use given rather than prohibited characters.

I also learnt some basic TKinter to create a GUI to show and input the letters rather than a basic console application which can be difficult to read.

It also used a new dictionary which has definitions in the JSON file, this allowed me to return the word meanings as the progra is searching to the 10 longest, and therefor most obscure, permitable words.
