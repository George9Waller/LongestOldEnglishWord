# LongestOldEnglishWord
An algorithm to find the longest word in a reduced alphabet: 


### ---Algorithm brief---

There once was a language call old english

No letters i and l had betwixt

Zebra or czarists could not be writ

And q and v did not persist


Tis from this alphabet you should write a script

to find the longest word that could exist.
